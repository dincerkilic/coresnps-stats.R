# Calculate core SNPs Statistics of Alignment Fasta File
R script to give statistics of core SNPs distances from a given pairwise fasta alignment file.

Program gives you the maximum, minimum, and the average number of core SNPs detected in pairwise fasta alignment file.

It is useful to have a preliminary idea about the genomic relatedness of your genomes that you pairwise aligned.

**Usage**
```sh
Rscript coreSNPS-stats.R your_pairwise_alignment_fasta_file
```

**Example**

There is a fasta alignment file, output of the tool Parsnp, in example folder to try the script.
