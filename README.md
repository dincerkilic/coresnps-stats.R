# Calculate core SNPs Statistics of Alignment Fasta File
R script to give statistics of core SNPs distances from a given fasta alignment file.

Program gives you the maximum, minimum, and the average number of core SNPs detected in fasta alignment file.

It is useful to have a preliminary idea about the genomic relatedness of your genomes that you aligned.

**Usage**
```sh
Rscript coresnps-stats.R your_fasta_alignment_file
```

**Example**

There is a fasta alignment file, output of the tool Parsnp, in example folder to try the script.
